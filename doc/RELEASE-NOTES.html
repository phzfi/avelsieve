<h2><a>Development Branch (1.9)</a></h2>

<p>The Devel Branch aims for some major changes, which are not considered
stable enough. In 1.9, the code has moved around and a lot of the GUI /
frontend parts have been ported to a new scheme, while other pars have been
completely rewritten.</p>


<h3>1.9.7 (The <em>It's Summertime</em> Release)</h3>

<p>Avelsieve 1.9.7 focuses on important bug fixes that aim for a stable 2.0
release. More detailed information about these fixes can be found in the
Changelog.</p>


<h3>1.9.6 (The <em>We're Opening Up To Other Servers</em> Release)</h3>

<p>This release adds the possibility to use different storage backends, instead
of only using ManageSieve protocol. Of course, the different backends need to
be written first. There are currently two skeletons (templates) in the code: a
File-based and a more generic one. </p>

<p>No other backends other than ManageSieve are implemented at this time. If
you are interested in writing a backend and plan to share it with the
community, please contact me in order to avoid duplicate work.</p>

<p>Also, in this release, there are a lot of bugfixes since Avelsieve 1.9.5 was
filled with bugs. Hopefully 2.0 will have very few of them.</p>



<h3>1.9.5 (The &quot;1.9.5.&quot; Release)</h3>

<p>Avelsieve 1.9.5 introduces some sort of integration between the Squirrelmail
Search page and the Sieve Filters. Perform a search in Squirrelmail, and with
the click on the link &quot;Create Filter&quot; you can instantly add a Sieve
rule.</p>

<p>Various bug{fixe}s continue to find their way into the code.</p>

<p>When upgrading, <em>remember to resync your config/config.php with
config/config_sample.php</em>. It is still changing in a lot of places, and it
is mostly important that you keep the new global statements in it.</p>

<p>A preview of the next steps in development: GUI refinements, support for
multiple Sieve scripts, support for scripts in shared folders via AnnotateMore
in Cyrus 2.3, multiple storage backends such as a simple file-based one (needed
for Exim4 filters) and much much more!</p>



<h3>1.9.4 (The &quot;Happy New Year&quot; Release)</h3>

<p>After almost six (!) months of small and big changes in the CVS, release
1.9.4 is out.</p>

<p>The major highlight in this release is the new condition GUI, which also
allows more Sieve features to be used in avelsieve. For example, envelope MAIL
FROM and TO (as well as AUTH in Cyrus) can be checked against, as well as the
body text of email messages wherever this is supported.</p>

<p>There is also a transitioning step, which will take place in the first time
that the rules are loaded. A slightly changed internal format will be written
back. This means that this version is not backward-compatible with any previous
'avelsieve' (&lt;= 1.9.3).</p>

<p>So a word of warning to all you early adopters: <strong>This is
beta</strong> so either</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Back up your Sieve scripts.</strong></li>
<li>Use this new avelsieve in a test, non-critical environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>That said, this version is up and running in a test environment (<a
href="http://email.uoa.gr/">email.uoa.gr demo site</a>) and a production
environment (University of Athens).</p>

<p>There are new configuration options. Keep your config/config.php in sync
with config/config_sample.php. I suggest <tt>vim -d</tt> ;) </p>

<p>Please feed with any bug reports at this stage. There are still things to be
done before a stable 2.0 is out. Enable debugging in config/config.php if
things start going wrong.</p>


<h3>1.9.3 (The &quot;We Are Still Alive&quot; Release)</h3>

<p>On the road to 2.0, this is mostly a maintenance and bugfix release for the
people who follow this devel branch. More changes will follow in 1.9.4.</p>


<h3>1.9.2 (&quot;The Interface Improvements Release&quot;)</h3>

<p>This release in the devel series focuses on usability and interface
enhancements.</p>

<p>Among the new features, the highlight is based on an idea and a patch by
Simon Matter: The concept of enabling and disabling rules on the fly, without
actually deleting them altogether, is introduced.</p>

<p>The descriptions of the rules, especially the &quot;terse&quot; description,
have been made more user-friendly.</p>

<p>There are more bugfixes, including a new way to encode/decode SIEVE scripts
from UTF-8 to the user's character set and vice versa. These fallback attempts
try to use iconv or recode.</p>

<p>Testing and bug reporting is much appreciated!</p>



<h3>1.9.1</h3>

<p>Welcome to another installment in the 1.9 series.</p>

<p>This release fixes some usability and business-logic bugs that slipped the
initial devel release. A fix for Dan's MANAGESIEVE class, upon which this whole
project was based, is also in. The off-by-one error could cause Apache / PHP to
get into an endless loop, until all the PHP memory limits were exhausted.
Hopefully this will make avelsieve just a bit more robust and secure.</p>

<p>Other than that, I believe that the 1.9 series is heading fast to become a
2.0 release. Before doing that, I would like to ensure compatibility with PHP5,
which means removing the hack that I've done, reasssigning '$this' in two
places of the new code.</p>

<p>At the moment nothing has changed in the way SIEVE scripts are being built.
The SIEVE scripts created are backward- and forward-compatible so far.</p>

<h3>1.9.0</h3>

<p>This is the first release of the next-gen avelsieve!</p>

<p>This release should be considered 'alpha quality'. At the moment it works
for me without any major glitches, but who knows, there might be a bug that
DoS'es the Apache Server by eating all of its memory in there. (I know there
<em>was</em> at least one of those, I fixed it some days ago).</p>

<p>Please try out the new <em>Edit Rule</em> page and report to me, or to the
squirrelmail-plugins mailing list, or to both, your annoyances, bugs and
wishes.</p>

<h2><a>Stable Branch (1.0)</a></h2>

<p>The code in this branch has practically lived as-is for enough months in
peoples' production servers that I consider it very stable and at least
soemwhat robust.</p>

<p>Some people still report that they cannot get avelsieve to remember the
rules - probably a session problem; but I can't figure out why that happens.
For most people it works without a glitch. If you find any difficulty in
getting it to work, please let me know.</p>


<h3>1.0.1</h3>

<p>This release simply incorporates the fix of the off-by-one bug in the
MANAGESIEVE class, to avoid hammering the Apache Server. Upgrading is
highly recommended.</p>

<h3>1.0</h3>

<p>Nothing much that warrants really the move from 0.9.x to 1.0, but some day
it had to be done!</p>
