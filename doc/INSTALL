Installing for the first time
-----------------------------

1) Untar the plugin under the squirrelmail/plugins directory. You probably have
already done this. :)

2) Copy config/config_sample.php to config/config.php. Edit config.php to your
preferences.  The file is self-documented with comments.

The defaults are OK for most installations.


Upgrading versions
------------------

1) Move the old avelsieve directory aside:
   mv avelsieve avelsieve-prev

2) Untar the new version.

3) Check the documentation (doc/NEWS.html) if there are any new configuration
   options.

4) Copy your previous configuration file:
   cp ../avelsieve-prev/config/config.php ./config/

5) You can also try a diff with the sample configuration file, if there are any
   changes:
   vim -d config_sample.php config.php
   
If and only if you are positive that things work as before (or, even, better),
then delete the old directory!
