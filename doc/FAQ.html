<strong>Cyrus Sieve server (timsieved) complains about size of Sieve scripts.</strong>
<br/><br/>

Sieve scripts can get quite large, especially with the metadata that avelsieve saves together
with the script.
<br/>
In Cyrus, you are advised to make the permitted Sieve script size bigger, in imapd.conf:<br/>
<pre>
 # Maximum size (in kilobytes) any sieve script can be, enforced at
 # submission by timsieved(8).
sieve_maxscriptsize: 32
</pre>
<br/>
Changing the default size of 32 kb to 64 or 128 kb should be OK for most purposes.

<strong>Using a ManageSieve backend against a non-ManageSieve-enabled server.</strong>
<br/><br/>

While it is possible to use the <em>file</em> storage backend, to store Sieve scripts
in the filesystem, it might be more convenient to use a standalone ManageSieve server
as a separate layer, and use the ManageSieve backend in avelsieve.<br/>
<br/>
You can use <a href="http://woozle.org/~neale/src/pysieved/">pysieved (Python
    Managesieve Server)</a> to accomplish this.
<br/><br/>
This way, you can use a ManageSieve interface to store scripts to be consumed
by Exim, Dovecot, Postfix etc.
